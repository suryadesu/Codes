"""
Method Overloading:
    If 2 methods having same name but different type of arguments then those methods are said to
    be overloaded methods
        But in Python Method overloading is not possible.
    If we are trying to declare multiple methods with same name and different number of arguments
    then Python will always consider only last method
    ython doesnâ€™t declare types in method declarations, so basically, in Java you can have this:

try:
    class Test:
        def m1(self): #reason datatypes
            print("no-arg method")
        def m1(self,a):
            print("one-arg method")
        def m1(self,a,b):
            print("two-arg method")
"""

class Test:
    def m1(self,a=None,b=None,c=None):
        if a!=None and b!=None and c!=None:
            print("The sum of 3 numbers" ,a+b+c)
        elif a!=None and b!=None :
            print(a+b)

t = Test()
t.m1("Vijay","kumar")
